5.2 Dependencies

Description

> This subsection of the SPMP shall specify the ordering relations among work packages to account for interdependencies among them and dependencies on external events. Techniques such as dependency lists, activity networks, and the critical path method may be used to depict dependencies among work packages.

Content:

The following list details the dependencies for each of the work packages specified in Section 5.1 of this document:
Note: All dependency lists for each sub-package are written in order of appearance on this list.

A. PlasmaGraph

	2. Data Graph Interface Module: SRS (C1), SDD (C2), SPMP (C4)

B. Product Documentation
	1. JavaDocs: SRS (C1), SDD (C2), SPMP (C4)

	2. User Manual: PlasmaGraph (A), JavaDocs (B1), SRS (C1), SDD (C2), STD (C3), SPMP (C4)
