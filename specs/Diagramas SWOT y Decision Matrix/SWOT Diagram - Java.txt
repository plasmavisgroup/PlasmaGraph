SWOT Diagram - Java
===================

Strengths:
	Portable (Linux / Windows / Mac.)
	High-level (Over C / C++.)
	GUI-friendly (Native GUI support.)
	Popular language.

Weaknesses:
	Object-Oriented (This process deals with few OO-centric concepts, so it's not as good a fit on the paradigm as something like C/C++.)
	Amount of processing. (May be demanding if done incorrectly?)

Opportunities
	Large variety of tools to use.
	Higher-quality tools due to lots of use and Open Source nature.

Threats
	Very popular language.
	Possible Virtual Machine vulnerabilities due to large number of possible attack vectors. (Short expected runtime / few uses that should not allow for attacks.)
