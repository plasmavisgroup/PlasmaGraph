Problems with the Data
=======================

1) Various text fields are useless for graphing purposes. (Referential CSV files, etc.)
	FIX: Remove any column that includes the words "File", "Time", "file", "time", and "Gas". Make sure to ignore the data if it's in that column! 
		- Will probably cause problems. Throw up a dialog box asking if they want to remove it, instead.

2) First field is fine, but all other fields start and end with a space. 
	FIX: Remove Leading Spaces for the first object of a row, and Remove Trailing Spaces for the last object of a row.
		AKA: Use "java.lang.String"'s "trim ()" method. Remember that it returns the data, so you need to put it in a container!

3) Second to last line is full of empty data. (",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,")
	FIX: Second pass over the data and remove all rows with no data in them.
		AKA: isEmpty() ?

4) Some large numbers use exponents. However, said exponents include a +.
	FIX: Use Double's "parseDouble (string s)". IT WORKS.
