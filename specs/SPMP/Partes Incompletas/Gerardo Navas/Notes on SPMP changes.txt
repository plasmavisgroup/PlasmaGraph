Notes on SPMP changes:

	Now that we're using GitHub instead of Dropbox, we need to do two big things:
		1) Remove all mentions of Dropbox and evalute how each of those situations changes with GitHub.
		2) Include how pushes and pulls will happen, how we'll perform individual commits, and how, when, and where the forks will merge. Explain why this is done, as well.

		Maybe an explanation of GitHub, as well?

	Add GitHub to Definitions.

	Include GitHub in tools / materials used.

Notes on other changes:
	
	Investigate SRS to see where Dropbox is mentioned.
