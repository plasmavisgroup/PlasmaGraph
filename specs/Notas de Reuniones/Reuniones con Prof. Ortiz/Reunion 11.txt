Meeting 11
======
Course / Class #: CECS 4800
Date: 20 November 2013

Project Name: PlasmaGraph

Has been done:
	1) SPMP: Revision 1 complete!
		a) Lacks attached list of resources used (5.4), although it exists in the PlasmaGraph repository, and Gantt Chart (5.5).
		b) Using Microsoft Project to create said Gantt Chart.
	2) SRS: Revision 1 complete!
		a) Basically complete, but lacks lots of polish and a few details.
	3) Prototype 1 Completed.
		a) Displays test data for each of the four main graph types: Bar Chart (Horizontal and Vertical), Pie Chart (No distinction between Horizontal and Vertical), XY Plot (Horizontal and Vertical), and Line Chart (Horizontal and Vertical).
		b) Has a set of options available.
		c) Allows saving of images, and editing of settings. (Settings changed via the ChartEditor [Right click -> Properties] do not change the Template; this means this feature will most likely be removed for the actual product.)
		d) Does not allow reading of data yet due to various Dataset conversion problems. (Solutions are already being developed; the likeliest of them involves usage of the CSVReader and CSVParser classes provided by OpenCSV in a CSVDataReader class that will read said CSV data files and correctly transfer the data into the appropriate JFreeChart Dataset.)
		e) Other graphs are being debated on. (Bar-and-Whisker, etc.) Largest problem is CSV data file parsing. Alternative input methods could be interesting, but probably outside the scope of the core of what the product will primarily do.

	4) SDD: Initial work started.
		a) Started work on SDD via hand-drawn diagrams of the Package and Class Diagrams.

What will be done:
	1) SPMP: Revision 2.
		a) Edits to older sections to update them with new data or with better explanations.
		b) More work on the Gantt Chart.
	2) SRS: Revisions to it as feedback is provided.
	3) SDD: Additional sketches of class methods and program flow.
	4) Prototype: CSV data file reading + Second version of GUI. (Implement a Presentation - Model pattern, not MVC or Blob, which is what we currently have.)
	5) Meeting with Client next week or the week after, depending on his availability.
