No recruiting will be made for version 1.0.
Work percentage requiement must be around 50%, with a margin of +/-10%.
Failure to do so will result in loss of claim of equal participation in project and a lesser grade.
Members calculated in work percentage are measured on not only percentage of code project made, but code documentation and SRS / SDD / STD / SPMP, and tests performed.
Documents must be shown to Prof. Ortiz to be changed from Alpha (v1) to Beta (v2).
