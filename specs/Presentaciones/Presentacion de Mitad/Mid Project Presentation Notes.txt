Presentation Composition
	PlasmaGraph? 
	Design Decisions / How Will it Be Made?
	Current Status
	Conclusion
	Questions

=========================================
PlasmaGraph? (Scenario)
	PUPR Plasma Laboratory produces lots of data. (Some is good, some is not good.)
	Data needs to be graphed relatively quickly.
	Data needs to be verified before used.
	Graphs need to be saved.
	Multiple computers in the lab.

=========================================
PlasmaGraph? (Solution)
	A portable, flexible graphing program which can import data, and can save images and settings; named "PlasmaGraph".

=========================================
Design Decisions
	Portability: Java. ("Build once, run anywhere.")
	Flexible: Templates. (Create a group of settings, save, and reuse and edit whenever.)
	Graphing: Java's "JFreeChart" library. (Set of tools that create flexible and powerful graphs.)
	Importing Data: Java's "OpenCSV" library and powerful file-reading tools. (Open CSV files, read them, and create data sets however is necessary.)
	Save Images: Java's "JFreeChart" library. (Again, it provides the tools to save graphs in both JPG and PNG formats.)
	Save Settings: Java's powerful file-writing tools. (Java's libraries are extensive and flexible.)

=========================================
How Will it Be Made?
	Two people.
		Gerardo A. Navas Morales
		Daniel Quintini

	Java IDE tools: Eclipse, NetBeans IDE

Project Work Package Tree
	<work_package_tree_2.png>

	(This diagram describes when the various required parts, known as work packages, will be created. It specifies this via requirements; that is, the SPMP and SRS must be completed before work on the SDD, first presentation, and prototype can begin. Note that only the first draft of each of these parts needs to be completed before the group can progress.)

=========================================
Current Status
	<work_package_tree_2_progress.png> (Copy of <work_package_tree_2.png>, except with blue circles for finished parts, and green circles for currently-in-progress parts.)
	(Blue means it has been finished. Green means it's being worked on. Otherwise, we aren't working on it yet. There is an exception to this; we'll mention it in a second.)

=========================================
Current Status (Cont.)
	First drafts of the SRS and SPMP are completed and being revised.
	SDD is being worked on.
	Prototype is finalized.
	STD's tests are being drafted up based on experience making Prototype.

=========================================
Work Remaining
	(Refer to <work_package_tree_2.png> to note what's missing still.)
	STD's tests are being drafted up based on experience making Prototype.
	Final product hasn't been started on.

	Once all that is done, the final Presentation will be made, and the project group will conclude operations.

=========================================
Conclusion
	PlasmaGraph is, in its core, a graphing system tailored for the tasks that the PUPR Plasma Lab requires.
	The project group is about halfway through development of all required products.
	Project is estimated to be completed before the end of PUPR's Winter 2013 (WI-13) trimester.
