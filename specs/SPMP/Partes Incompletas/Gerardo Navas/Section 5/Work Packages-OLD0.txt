Description

> This subsection of the SPMP shall specify the work packages for the activities and tasks that must be completed in order to satisfy the project agreement.

> As mentioned in this project's SRS, the requirements for PlasmaGraph stipulate a number of important functions that it must perform. This product must include the following modules:

1. Plasma Data Sanitizer: The product must take as input a CSV file, read and analyze its contents, edit (or purge) the data as necessary in order to standardize it, and the provide necessary vector to pass said data to the next module, the Data Graph Interface Module.

This module consists of a Data Sanitizer sub-module and the transport code sub-module that manages data through the product.

2. Data Graph Interface Module: This module must take as input the data provided to it by the Plasma Data Sanitizer. With it, this module will obtain from the user data regarding how s/he wishes to graph the sanitized data, and graph it in said manner. It must also provide a GUI for editing said options, and the ability to save both the options chosen and/or the graph as an image.

This module consists of the program's GUI sub-module and back-end code, and the Graph sub-module. The GUI sub-module will include the image-saving and template-loading/saving functions.
